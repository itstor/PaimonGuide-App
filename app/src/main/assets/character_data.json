Press Commands the power of earth to create a Stone Stele.  Hold Causes nearby Geo energy to explode, causing the following effects: \u00b7If their maximum number hasn't been reached, creates a Stone Stele. \u00b7Creates a shield of jade. The shield's DMG Absorption scales based on Zhongli's Max HP. \u00b7Deals AoE Geo DMG. \u00b7If there are nearby targets with the Geo element, it will drain a large amount of Geo element from a maximum of 2 such targets. This effect does not cause DMG.  Stone Stele When created, deals AoE Geo DMG. Additionally, it will intermittently resonate with other nearby Geo constructs, dealing Geo DMG to nearby opponents. The Stone Stele is considered a Geo construct that can both be climbed and used to block attacks. Only one Stele created by Zhongli himself may initially exist at any one time.  Jade Shield Possesses 150% DMG Absorption against all Elemental and Physical DMG. Characters protected by the Jade Shield will decrease the Elemental RES and Physical RES of opponents in a small AoE by 20%. This effect cannot be stacked.  A true master of stone may carve jade and shape gold."
